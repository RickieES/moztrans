--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.25
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New semi-automatic accesskeys assignment feature.

* Most Chrome and Edit views actions have now their own button image.

* Advanced Search dialog has been slightly redesigned and now text field
  content is selected on focus gain.

* In Search and Replace dialogs, text fields content are selected on focus
  gain.

* Sorting columns in table views is faster, although Product column is
  still reaaaaaaally slow (and I don't know why).

* Fix for an endless loop when reading a .properties file which is not
  actually a Properties file.

* About dialog now performs a System.gc() (memory garbage collect) and
  displays memory figures.

* MozillaTranslator now renames Glossary.zip to Glossary.bkf on save, thus
  creating a backup before saving.

* If an OutOfMemory exception happens while saving Glossary.zip, MT tries
  to save glossary.txt (the actual text file inside Glossary.zip with the
  datamodel; it still means that image files will be lost if no
  Glossary.bkf is around, but at least the text-based work will survive).

* Lots of code cleanup.

Known bugs: there is a nasty memory leak still not traced to root cause,
so it is strongly recommended to run MT with -Xms 128M -Xmx 512M (your
figures may be different depending on your glossary size).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Run "All Above at Once" automated test no longer throws false positives
  (bug 461203).

* New automated tests: duplicated words and mismatched characters (bug 461025).

* Tree in Import/Export file dialog gets refreshed on every invocation, so
  if there are new/obsolete files due to a product update, the tree reflects
  the changes (bug 461024).

* New translation suggestions feature in Edit Phrase Dialog (bug 461022).

* Redundant View no longer throws an exception (bug 450464).

* Adjusted some dialog and controls to look good in new Nimbus Look & Feel.

* Revamped setup dialog.

* "QA Queries" renamed to "Automated Tests Queries" to better suit
  Axel's taste. :-)

* Changed references to specific "CVS" to generic "SCM" (Source Control
  Management).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* MozillaTranslator no longer complains on empty region JAR files when writing
  XPIs for products without region JAR files (bug 445558).

* Added preference to set fonts for Edit Phrase dialog and table views, as some
  L10n teams were having problems with DialogInput and Dialog fonts (bug 445557).

* MozillaTranslator now can check for different ending characters in original
  vs. translated strings (bug 439352).

  ** WARNING **: this MAY raise a number of errors in your translation. Fixing
  them may require filing bugs to request approval, since L10n for Firefox 3
  is frozen.

* MozillaTranslator properly handles now newline escape sequences
  (bug 439349). Properties file escape sequences in the form \r\n or \n
  were wrongly removed and parsed as real newlines, which was wrong, despite
  it works and looks nicer in the Edit Phrase dialog. This has been solved.

  ** WARNING **: this WILL raise a number of modified strings in the properties
  files. You will need to fix the corresponding translations, which may require
  filing bugs to request approval, since L10n for Firefox 3 is frozen.

* MozillaTranslator now parses INI files as Properties files (bug 420450).

  ** WARNING **: this means that, if you had translated the file as a
  "MT_UnknownFormatFile" node, you will lose the translation. To solve it,
  make sure you have exported the translated file before updating MT, and
  import the translated file after updating MT to v5.23.

* Images no longer appear as modified on every Update Product run unless
  they are really modified (bug 415975)
* MozillaTranslator now properly manages weird Firefox/Thunderbird ab-CD.JAR
  structures (bug 383914)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* MozillaTranslator no longer asks twice for the path to localization import
  (bug 384465).
* "Do not show this dialog again" tickable box now behaves properly if
  switched on/off in the same dialog run (bug 393840).
* "All above at once" QA query shortcut changed from [Ctrl]+[A] to
  [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[A], and Advanced Search shortcut set to
  [Shift]+[Ctrl]+[F] (bug 393841).
* When importing or exporting a file (Import -> File and Export -> File),
  if you select file "foo.dtd" in the tree selector from MT product, and
  then type/choose a file in disk named other than "foo.dtd", you'll get a
  confirmation dialog, to prevent you from overwriting files (bug 408549).
* Edit Phrase Dialog includes now the current entity/key name in the
  dialog title (bug 408551).
* Cursor focus is placed in the translated textarea on entering Edit Phrase
  dialog, since it is where the localizer is going to type (bug 408551).
* You can now type the ellipsis "â€¦" without having to resort to copy &
  paste from the original string with the [Alt]+[.] combination in both
  Edith Phrase dialog (Translated textarea) and in table view (Translated
  column cells) (bug 408551).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added a "export to" field for CVS exports, so MT can deal with the
  differences between en-US and ab-CD different directory layouts in
  Mozilla CVS (bug 376285).
* Locale Field in Show Which Columns dialog is now mandatory and must have
  at least two characters, to prevent people translating for (null) and
  getting angry when later they discover they have just lose everything. :-)
* MT ignores now ".svn" directories as well as "CVS" on CVS imports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Localization notes are now parsed for DTD and Properties files, and
  persisted in Glossary.zip (bug 363691).
* New QA query for strings with a DONT_TRANSLATE localization note, but
  still having translation (bug 363691).
* Edit -> QA queries -> Check above all at once includes DONT_TRANSLATE
  QA query.
* Text files others than DTD/Properties can be imported now with an
  specific charset selected by user on MT preferences, including UTF-8
  (bug 253214).
* JAR and XPI exports manage now the localeVersion in a better, more
  strict way (bug 258274).
* Chrome View shows image files inside the window, avoiding having to
  go to "Edit Image file" button (bug 161247).
* New "Info" tab in Chrome View allows to know some data about the
  component/file selected in tree, and provides statistics (bug 161247).
* Check Variables QA query detects now more errors: ${variable} parameters
  for Properties files inside installer directory, DTD entities (with
  two new preferences for excluding entities from comparison), and %name%
  parameters for Properties files.
* Language packs can now be created with the right permissions, by making
  a external call to zip/unzip utilities (bug 197792). This is only needed
  on Linux (and possibly Mac OS X); Windows didn't show this problem.
* Shortcuts on MozillaTranslator GUI have been changed to use [Ctrl]
  instead [Alt], adding and removing some of them (bug 363833).
* Update Product includes now functionality of Import CVS Directory (which
  has been removed).
* Updating a product (either JAR or CVS based) saves the old original value in
  the QA result field for review/comparison purposes.
* Edit Product dialog has been redesigned.
* Several visual minor enhancements to Import JAR dialog.
* Loading and saving Glossary.zip shows now more information about the
  progress of action.
* MT runs OK now with JRE 1.6 in Windows (and Linux), despite a minor
  difference in the behaviour of JRE in both platforms regarding SAX
  parsing.
* Yet another error on external entities persistence (they weren't properly
  loaded from Glossary.zip) fixed.
* Dependency of Apache's implementation of Soundex algorithm has been
  removed, by reimplementing it as part of org.mozillatranslator.util.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DTDs with PE references were not having their external entities being
  persisted in Glossary.zip; that's solved now. A product refresh (File
  -> Product Update or Import -> CVS Import Directory) should be done,
  followed by a File -> Save Glossary run to get the external entities
  correctly saved in the Glossary.zip
* PE references were being exported with a missing ";". Also, "PUBLIC"
  and "SYSTEM" were being swapped, thus exporting as PUBLIC PEs what actually
  were SYSTEM and viceversa (I'll put my wet fingers into the plug by this one).
* When no customized install.properties was found in working dir, MT was
  unable to correcty load the bundled install.properties in mt51x.jar.
  This is solved.
* If a file in the glossary turned into a directory, or viceversa, a
  ClassCastException was raised and Update time (File -> Update Product or
  Import -> CVS Directory), and no update happened. This is solved now.
* Added new buttons in chrome / list views to allow fuzzy/unfuzzy,
  keep/unkeep original and clear translation texts in multiple strings
  selected by user (either consecutive or sparced).
* Migrate product now works again.
* Chrome View now shows components and files sorted by name (components
  always before files).
* Added new "Check Variables" query, looking for errors in %S, %1$S
  parameter mismatch between original and translation.
* Added new, non persistent filterResult field to Phrase to hold information
  about some QA queries (Check keybinding, Check variables). This new field
  is visible in read-only way as the new "Result comment" column in Chrome
  View. A new tab has been added to Edit Phrase dialog to accomodate this
  field.
* Plain files and binary files "MT_UnknownFileType" fake rows display now
  "No translated content available" if there is no translation. This makes
  easier to find out which images actually have translations and which
  should have "Keep original" flag set.
* Table tooltip "Click header to sort..." removed by popular demand.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DTDs with PE references are currently correctly imported and exported.
* Solved problem with Import -> Translation
* When exporting an XPI, install.properties is now correctly bundled
  along with install.js. You can get XPI to show localized installation
  messages by translating install.properties and putting in your working
  directory (next to Glossary.zip).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Solved high CPU usage when sorting a view on File column.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Multiple directories are correctly managed now. For this, MT_default
  ficticious branches no longer exist. Instead, if a directory (categorized
  as a Component) includes both directories and files, the Chrome View
  sort them so files are always behind directories.
* CVS Import directory now correctly removes obsolete files and entities,
  so there is no further needed to create a new product, import, migrate
  and delete the old one.
* Original file license (delimited with ***** BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK *** ...
  ***** END LICENSE BLOCK *****) now is preserved; it is possible also
  include the localizer as contributor (new preference added at File ->
  Setup -> License).
* Enhanced accesskeys and commandkeys vs. label & buttons detection,
  including the ability for user to set which key suffixes tag the string
  as a label, an accesskey or a commandkey.
* Field "Comment" added to persistance (i.e.: saved in Glossary.zip). But
  it keeps being tied to the _translation_ instead of the _phrase_ so you
  can't get it to persist if the string is marked as "Keep Original".
* New "Replace" feature, for quick changing translated strings.
* Edit Image dialog now has an additional button to switch between vertical
  and horizontal split. A bit rough (usually a window resize is needed to
  make everything fit gently), but it works (more or less).
* Some typos corrected.
* Fixed error in build.xml making Userguide.odt being included in the JAR.
* Development environment upgraded to NetBeans 5.5 Beta 2.
* Added debug targets to build.xml for its use in NetBeans 5.5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.05pl5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed a regression in the directory name for saved images into the glossary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.05pl2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed install.js to work with OS/2
* .properties files are written now in UTF-8 and do not include date/time comment
  (which was a Bad Thing (tm) for CVS)
* minor usability enhancements in Edit Phrase Dialog


------------------------------
Refactoring options
------------------------------
* Change ComplexColumn from interface to AbstractClass and add common code.
* Make private Controls in the dialogs to use Local variables if they are not needed outside init
* Make file IO pluggable (new IO sub system)
* Toolbar FOnt settings.
