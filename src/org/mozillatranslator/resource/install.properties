install_confirm = This process will either install the language pack globally (in browser\'s installation chrome folder) or locally (in your current Profile chrome folder). The advantage of a global install is that it need only be installed once and becomes available to all profiles (similar to the English language pack). The disadvantage is that you might need administator rights to do that.\n\nDo you prefer a global installation? (Cancelling will perform a local installation.)
